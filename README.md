This project usess CRUD and ORM (object-relation mapping), Flask and SQLAlchemy). This project taught me how to use the Visual Studio SQLite extension also about lambda

Grocery database program written in Python3 and SQLAlchemy database software

also i found out about this by googling around the internet encoungering a db error for the program

Found out about Redshift Driver and SQLTools Extension in Visual Studio code, good for the app, then later found out about DB Browser for SQLite on Mac OS X

use import logging (a good module for Python3) but didnt get a chance to use it
